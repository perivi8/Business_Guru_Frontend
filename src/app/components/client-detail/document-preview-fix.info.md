# Document Preview Fix Implementation

## Problem
When a document is updated in the client edit page, the preview in the client detail page shows the old document instead of the updated one.

## Root Cause
The client detail component was not refreshing its data to get the latest document URLs after an update.

## Solution Implemented

1. **Enhanced previewDocument method**: 
   - Added data refresh before previewing any document
   - Created a new `refreshAndPreviewDocument` method that reloads client data before previewing

2. **Client detail component updates**:
   - Added subscription to query parameters to detect when coming back from edit page
   - Enhanced ngOnInit to reload data when the reload query parameter is present
   - Added client update subscription to automatically refresh when client data changes

3. **Edit client component updates**:
   - Modified navigation to client detail page to include a reload query parameter
   - Added handling for deleted documents in the saveClient method

4. **Service layer**:
   - Confirmed that client service already notifies about updates through clientUpdated$ observable

## Key Changes

### client-detail.component.ts
- Modified `previewDocument` to refresh data before previewing
- Added `refreshAndPreviewDocument` method for data refresh
- Enhanced `ngOnInit` to handle reload query parameter
- Added client update subscription

### edit-client.component.ts
- Modified navigation to include reload query parameter
- Added handling for deleted documents

## Testing
The fix ensures that:
1. When a user uploads a new document and saves in the edit page
2. They are navigated back to the client detail page with reload=true
3. The client detail page refreshes its data to get the latest document URLs
4. When they click preview, they see the updated document

This resolves the issue where users were seeing old documents in the preview after uploading new ones.
