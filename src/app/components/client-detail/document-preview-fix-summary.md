# Document Preview Fix Summary

## Issue
When a user uploads a new document in the client edit page and then navigates to the client detail page to preview the document, they see the old document instead of the newly uploaded one.

## Root Cause
The client detail component was not refreshing its data to get the latest document URLs after an update from the edit page.

## Solution
Implemented a comprehensive fix that ensures document previews always show the most recent version by:

1. **Enhanced Document Preview Logic**:
   - Modified the `previewDocument` method to refresh client data before showing any document preview
   - Created a new `refreshAndPreviewDocument` method that reloads client data from the server before previewing

2. **Automatic Data Refresh**:
   - Enhanced `ngOnInit` to check for a reload query parameter when navigating back from the edit page
   - Added subscription to client updates through the service's `clientUpdated$` observable
   - Modified the edit client component to navigate back with a reload parameter

3. **Improved Edit Client Component**:
   - Added handling for deleted documents in the save process
   - Ensured proper navigation back to client detail with refresh trigger

## Files Modified

### 1. `client-detail.component.ts`
- Modified `previewDocument` method to refresh data before previewing
- Added `refreshAndPreviewDocument` method for data refresh
- Enhanced `ngOnInit` to handle reload query parameter and client update subscriptions
- Updated `saveEdit` method to notify about client updates

### 2. `edit-client.component.ts`
- Modified navigation to include reload query parameter
- Added handling for deleted documents in save process

## How It Works

1. **User uploads new document** in edit client page
2. **User saves changes** which triggers:
   - Document upload to server
   - Navigation back to client detail with `reload=true` parameter
3. **Client detail page detects reload parameter** and:
   - Automatically refreshes client data from server
   - Updates internal client object with latest information including new document URLs
4. **User clicks preview** which now:
   - First refreshes client data to ensure latest URLs
   - Shows the updated document instead of the old cached version

## Testing
The fix has been implemented to ensure:
- Document previews always show the most recently uploaded version
- No manual refresh is required by the user
- All document types (business documents, GST documents, etc.) are handled correctly
- Both direct URL previews and service-based previews work with updated data

This resolves the issue where users were seeing stale document previews after uploading new versions.
